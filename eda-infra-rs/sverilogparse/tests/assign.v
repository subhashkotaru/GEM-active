// 3{y} is the same as {y, y, y}
/// assign z = {3{y}};    /// TODO: replication not supported yet.

// Case #9: LHS can also be concatenated: a is 2-bit vector and b is scalar
// RHS is evaluated to 11001 and LHS is 3-bit wide so first 3 bits from LSB of RHS
// will be assigned to LHS. So a = 'b00 and b ='b1
